# Tutorial
This repository has a little website that shows some web stuff. Look around and see you can figure it out. We will go over it when we meet next.
- index.html is the main file. Notice how it links to the other two files. It has a form in it, which is how webpages can have text boxes and drop-down boxes.
- styles.css is the stylesheet. You can change fonts, colors, etc.
- index.js is the JavaScript file. 

## Assignment
